        <h1>Brief history of how it started... </h1>
        <p>FooDo was created with the goal of reducing food waste and fostering local communities.
          FooDo's mission is to create a more sustainable and equitable food system by reducing food waste, helping
          people in need, and fostering community connections. By allowing users to share surplus food with their
          neighbors, FooDo aims to reduce the amount of food that ends up in landfills and to provide food to those who
          may not have access to it. FooDo is a platform to connect the one's who are in need with the one who is
          willing to donate..</p>
